## Development Notes

### Email Notifications
Currently, email notifications are logged to the console and stored in localStorage. In a production environment, you would:
1. Set up a backend server
2. Configure email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
3. Replace the `sendEmailNotification` function with actual API calls

### Security Considerations
- This is a frontend-only demo
- In production, implement proper authentication
- Add CSRF protection and input sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all communications

### Future Enhancements
- Backend integration
- Database storage
- Real email notifications
- User profile editing
- Highlight upload functionality
- Admin dashboard
